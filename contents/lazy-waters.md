# Lazy Waters - The Byrds

```
 E               F#m                B
When I was young I'd go down by the river
F#m          B                 E                  E7
Just about a mile from my home a million miles from everyone
   A                  B             E          D          C#7
My eyes could see your waters as my ears could hear your song
F#m      B          F#m              B
Oh to be wild again get back to your lazy waters
F#m             B       E
Never needed anyone but you

E                           F#m           B
Oh little boys are strange  no one knows they have magic
F#m            B               E              E7
I kept it in my pocket  concealed from everyone
A                         B       E      D       C#7
But I climbed the highest tree to sing a bird my song
F#m      B          F#m              B
Oh to be wise again get back to your lazy waters
F#m             B       E
Never needed anyone but you

E                    F#m               B    
We moved to the city I said I wouldn't mind 
F#m                    B             E              E7
thought you'd stay inside me    It's easy when your young
A         B          E  D            C#7
But as we rode away  I knew you were gone
F#m      B          F#m               B
Oh to be wise again get back to your lazy waters
F#m              B      E
Never needed anyone but you
