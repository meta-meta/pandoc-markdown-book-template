```
E          G#m            G          F#m          B7
 To lead a better life    I need my love to be here

E     F#m    G#m           A         
Here,        making each day of the year
E     F#m    G#m           A             D#m              G#7
             Changing my life with a    wave of her hand
D#m          G#7        C#m                F#m          B7
No  - body can      deny    that there's something there

E     F#m    G#m         A   
There,       running my hands through her hair
E     F#m    G#m           A            D#m           G#7
             Both of us thinking how    good it can be 
D#m              G#7         C#m         F#m            B7
Someone is speaking,    but she doesn't know he's there 

            G         Em      Am              B7            Em
I want her everywhere   And if she's beside me I know I need never care
Am              B7             E         F#m    G#m            A 
But to love her is to need her everywhere       Knowing that love is to share 
E     F#m    G#m          A             D#m              G#7
             Each one believing that    love never dies 
D#m              G#7          C#m       F#m         B7
Watching their eyes   and hoping I'm always there 

            G           Em           Am             B7            Em
I want her everywhere        And if she's beside me I know I need never care
Am              B7
But to love her is to need her 
 E          F#m   G#m            A   
everywhere        Knowing that love is to share
E     F#m    G#m          A             D#m              G#7
             Each one believing that    love never dies 

D#m              G#7          C#m       F#m         B7
Watching their eyes     and hoping I'm always there 
          E     F#m      G#m         A         
I will be there      and everywhere
E     F#m       G#m        A         E
Here, there and everywhere
